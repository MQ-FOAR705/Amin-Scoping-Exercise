\section{A Day in the Life}

I need to:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Search the university library database for articles, books and other resources.
    \item Organise the articles I have downloaded into an orderly fashion for ease of access.
    \item Skim through the articles I pick and select the most relevant ones for my research project for the day.
    \item Edit several pages worth of text.
    \item Write and file ideas etc. which may be used later.
    \item Referencing.
    \item Create a list to plan my day.
    \item Create a mind-map to gather my thoughts.
    \item Contact my supervisor to clarify something.
    \item Assimilate a significant amount of theoretical knowledge.
\end{itemize}

\section{Pains and Pain relievers}

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textit{Making sure my grammar and word use is correct.} RELIEVER: A grammar and spell checking application.
    \item \textit{Make sure my work is fully referenced and the bibliography is consistent.} RELIEVER: An automatic referencing application
    \item \textit{Memorising and understanding complex ideas and theories.} RELIEVER: Some kind of software to create easy to follow 'cheat sheets' to help with memorisation. If it can also set a timer to dictate the duration between exposures to aid in my memory that would be a bonus.
\end{itemize}

\section{Gains and gain creators}

\begin{enumerate}
\item  \textit {I would like to be able to open multiple similar articles in the one place and easily search for terms within them collectively and seamlessly.} CREATOR: An application which allows for multiple PDF's, Word Docs and other documents to be open within it which enables cross document searches.
\item \item \textit {I would like to map out the main arguments of single and multiple papers in an easy to absorb way.} CREATOR: An application which allows me to chunk papers and other large amounts of texts and data into smaller pieces.
\end{enumerate}
